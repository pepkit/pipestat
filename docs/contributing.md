We welcome contributions from the community.

## New assets

We are interested in working with groups who want to add assets into the refgenie system. If you want to add an asset, you can do so by following the templates in the [asset build recipes file](https://github.com/databio/refgenie/blob/master/refgenie/asset_build_packages.py). We are exploring ways of making this more approachable but for now, that's the way to do it.

## Suggestions and feedback

Please open an issue on the github issue tracker with suggestions, bug reports, or other feedback.
